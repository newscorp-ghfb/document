This project contains code that was developed as part of the Scala standard library but was later deprecated
A basic pretty-printing library, based on Lindig's strict version of Wadler's adaptation of Hughes' pretty-printer derived from [Document.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.8/src/library/scala/text/Document.scala) whose author was Michel Schinz

## Further info

* [The design of a pretty-printing library](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/pretty.html) by John Hughes, describes the original pretty-printing library in Haskell, [PDF](http://belle.sourceforge.net/doc/hughes95design.pdf)
* [Strictly Pretty Paper](https://lindig.github.io/papers/strictly-pretty-2000.pdf) by Christian Lindig, describes a strict implementation of the pretty printing algorithm in OCaml
